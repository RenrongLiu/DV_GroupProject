It is also interesting to study the mechanism behind the algorithms. Although this class is not about data mining or machine learning, from my understanding, data visualization could be an indispensable component in data mining or machine learning. Before the data preprocessing, we need to do some exploratory data analysis to firgue out the possible patterns of our dataset and get a direction for our data preprocessing. After we finish the modeling and prediction part, data visualization is also important for us to present our results to others. Visual plots could be more intuitive and direct for people to understand no matter whether they have professional knowledge or not.  I have already taken a course to use Python and Tableau to do the visualization, it will be a pleasure to take a course based on R.
